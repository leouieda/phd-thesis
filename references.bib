  abstract = {The Almada Basin, located in the southern Bahia State segment of NE Brazil, shares a similar sedimentation history and stress regime with the other eastern Brazilian basins. But when considering the composition of the transitional crust, a remarkably different behaviour is observed between the Almada Basin and the other eastern Brazilian basins. The architectural elements of the basin such as the reflection Moho discontinuity, the oceanic and continental basements, and the sedimentary section, as well as the tectonic style, are discussed in this study using gravity, seismic, regional geology and well-drilling results.
The Almada Basin is part of a continental rift system that developed during the Early Cretaceous, heralding the Gondwana break-up and subsequently evolving into a passive divergent margin. Deep seismic profiles show the progressive thinning of the continental crust but there is no clear evidence of mantle exhumation.
The Almada Basin is the conjugate margin of the South Gabon Basin in West Africa. Although both basins display similar stratigraphic record and geological evolution, the rifting mechanism resulted in a considerable asymmetric break-up. The Almada Basin is floored by the Itabunas{\textendash}Salvador{\textendash}Cura{\c c}{\'a} Belt of the S{\~a}o Francisco Craton and is characterized by Palaeoproterozoic granulites in a high-angle east-dipping thrust fault regime. However, the South Gabon Basin lies on the Neoproterozoic West Congolian Belt that is made up of low- to medium-grade metamorphic rocks in a low-angle thrust tectonic regime. The Precambrian basement fabric of both the Almada and South Gabon basins is marked by lithospheric-scale discontinuities that controlled the implantation of the rift zone and the extension style during the Mesozoic. The strong basement structural inheritance can be recognized in both the geological and geophysical records.
The key architectural elements of a volcanic margin, such as large igneous provinces, seaward-dipping reflectors and the basinal syn-rift magmatism, are not recognized in the Almada Basin. Although the South Atlantic margin is mostly volcanic in the southernmost segment, the presence of these two non-volcanic segments {\textendash} the southern Bahia State and the southern Gabon {\textendash} are important as a record of the differences in the geotectonic process that governed the formation of the South Atlantic divergent margins.},

  abstract = {The ruins of the St Catherine's monastery complex, the largest sacral ruins in Slovakia, are an important example of Slovak cultural heritage. The Franciscan monastery was a famous site of religious significance due to the legends describing the apparitions of St Catherine. The preservation project of the monastery remains started in 1994. As a part of this project, complex historical, archaeological, anthropological and geophysical research has been conducted at the site since 1997. Microgravity and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were carried out in the nave of the former church in order to reveal the position of three aristocratic crypts that served as burial places for the members or higher society in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In the microgravity data processing, a novel method for the calculation of the building correction was employed, where the gravitational effect of the church is calculated using a polyhedral model of the building created from photographs with a special photogrammetric software. Several gravity anomalies were found in the residual Bouguer anomaly map. Semi-automated interpretation techniques including the Euler deconvolution and harmonic inversion have been used to investigate the depth and size of anomalous sources. Results from 36 GPR profiles obtained by a 400\hspace{0.167em}MHz antenna were visualized in the form of horizontal time-slices and vertical time-sections. These images indicate anomalous reflections suggesting potential archaeological targets. Integrated interpretation of results from both geophysical methods has confirmed the presence of a known aristocratic crypt excavated in 2001, as well as two other crypts predicted from historical archives. The combination of microgravity and GPR surveys has proved to be a very effective and non-destructive tool for archaeological research. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Throughout the past decade, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has given an unprecedented view on global variations in terrestrial water storage. While an increasing number of case studies have provided a rich overview on regional analyses, a global assessment on the dominant features of GRACE variability is still lacking. To address this, we survey key features of temporal variability in the GRACE record by decomposing gridded time series of monthly equivalent water height into linear trends, inter-annual, seasonal, and subseasonal (intra-annual) components. We provide an overview of the relative importance and spatial distribution of these components globally. A correlation analysis with precipitation and temperature reveals that both the inter-annual and subseasonal anomalies are tightly related to fluctuations in the atmospheric forcing. As a novelty, we show that for large regions of the world high-frequency anomalies in the monthly GRACE signal, which have been partly interpreted as noise, can be statistically reconstructed from daily precipitation once an adequate averaging filter is applied. This filter integrates the temporally decaying contribution of precipitation to the storage changes in any given month, including earlier precipitation. Finally, we also survey extreme dry anomalies in the GRACE record and relate them to documented drought events. This global assessment sets regional studies in a broader context and reveals phenomena that had not been documented so far.},

This process can be tedious and is often done manually, since available commercial or in-house software usually can do only part of the job. To expedite this process, we introduce the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), which is a free, public domain software package that can be used to manipulate columns of tabular data, time series, and gridded data sets and to display these data in a variety of forms ranging from simple x-y plots to maps and color, perspective, and shaded-relief illustrations. GMT uses the PostScript page description language, which can create arbitrarily complex images in gray tones or 24-bit true color by superimposing multiple plot files. Line drawings, bitmapped images, and text can be easily combined in one illustration. PostScript plot files are device-independent, meaning the same file can be printed at 300 dots per inch (dpi) on an ordinary laserwriter or at 2470 dpi on a phototypesetter when ultimate quality is needed. GMT software is written as a set of UNIX tools and is totally self contained and fully documented. The system is offered free of charge to federal agencies and nonprofit educational organizations worldwide and is distributed over the computer network Internet.},

  abstract = {Computer programs based on the exact calculations of the gravity and magnetic anomalies of polygonal prisms are faster in operation and more accurate than previous programs based on the numerical integration of polygonal laminas. The prism programs also are of more general application than existing computer programs that are based on the exact gravity and magnetic effects of rectangular prisms. There are no restrictions on the use of the exact formula for the gravitational attraction of a polygonal prism, but the formulas for the magnetic effect are restricted in that demagnetization is not considered, and a finite answer is not obtained in the unrealistic circumstance where an observation point coincides with an edge of the prism. Least-squares methods permit calculation of the gravity or magnetic effect of models without knowledge of the density or magnetization contrasts, respectively, by comparison of the observed anomalies with theoretical dimensionless values to determine contrasts as regression coefficients. The coefficient of correlation provides a goodness of fit estimate that helps model evaluation. After calculating a magnetic terrain correction for an outcrop of Quaternary dacite and andestite near Clear Lake, Calif., an improvement of the coefficient of correlation from 88 to the 92 percent level indicates that this volcanic unit probably extends at least 150 m beneath the surface. Application of a magnetic terrain correction to disconnected outcrops of Tertiary andesite, eliminates most of a prominent v-shaped magnetic anomaly south of the San Juan Mountains, Colo.},

Two types of sources that produce the same magnetic field are studied in detail: thin sheets and uniaxially magnetized half-spaces. Simple analytic solutions show that their magnetization variations are essentially given by the pseudogravity field and the magnetic field, respectively. While the former varies slowly to account for the slow variation in the vertically integrated magnetization, the latter varies rapidly to account for the spatial variation in rock magnetization close to the observation points. An extension of these simple distributions is the sandwich distribution. Using statistical arguments, we construct sandwich distributions. The depths and mean magnetizations of each layer are found from the decay of the azimuthally averaged power spectrum. The equivalent layer magnetizations closely resemble the magnetic field anomaly when upward-continued to a height equal to the mean depth of the layer.},

  abstract = {Several noniterative, imaging methods for potential field data have been proposed that provide an estimate of the 3D magnetization/density distribution within the subsurface or that produce images of quantities related or proportional to such distributions. They have been derived in various ways, using generalized linear inversion, Wiener filtering, wavelet and depth from extreme points (DEXP) transformations, crosscorrelation, and migration. We demonstrated that the resulting images from each of these approaches are equivalent to an upward continuation of the data, weighted by a (possibly) depth-dependent function. Source distributions or related quantities imaged by all of these methods are smeared, diffuse versions of the true distributions; but owing to the stability of upward continuation, resolution may be substantially increased by coupling derivative and upward continuation operators. These imaging techniques appeared most effective in the case of isolated, compact, and depth-limited sources. Because all the approaches were noniterative, computationally fast, and in some cases, produced a fit to the data, they did provide a quick, but approximate picture of physical property distributions. We have found that inherent or explicit depth-weighting is necessary to image sources at their correct depths, and that the best scaling law or weighting function has to be physically based, for instance, using the theory of homogeneous fields. A major advantage of these techniques was their speed, efficiently providing a basis for further detailed, follow-up modelling.},

  volume = {64},
  issn = {0016-8033},
  doi = {10.1190/1.1444585},
  abstract = {We present a new, stable method for interpreting the basement relief of a sedimentary basin which delineates sharp discontinuities in the basement relief and incorporates any law known a priori for the spatial variation of the density contrast. The subsurface region containing the basin is discretized into a grid of juxtaposed elementary prisms whose density contrasts are the parameters to be estimated. Any vertical line must intersect the basement relief only once, and the mass deficiency must be concentrated near the earth's surface, subject to the observed gravity anomaly being fitted within the experimental errors. In addition, upper and lower bounds on the density contrast of each prism are introduced a priori (one of the bounds being zero), and the method assigns to each elementary prism a density contrast which is close to either bound. The basement relief is therefore delineated by the contact between the prisms with null and nonnull estimated density contrasts, the latter occupying the upper part of the discretized region. The method is stabilized by introducing constraints favoring solutions having the attributes (shared by most sedimentary basins) of being an isolated compact source with lateral borders dipping either vertically or toward the basin center and having horizontal dimensions much greater than its largest vertical dimension. Arbitrary laws of spatial variations of the density contrast, if known a priori, may be incorporated into the problem by assigning suitable values to the nonnull bound of each prism. The proposed method differs from previous stable methods by using no smoothness constraint on the interface to be estimated. As a result, it may be applied not only to intracratonic sag basins where the basement relief is essentially smooth but also to rift basins whose basements present discontinuities caused by faults. The method's utility in mapping such basements was demonstrated in tests using synthetic data produced by simulated rift basins. The method mapped with good precision a sequence of step faults which are close to each other and present small vertical slips, a feature particularly difficult to detect from gravity data only. The method was also able to map isolated discontinuities with large vertical throw. The method was applied to the gravity data from Reco⁁ncavo basin, Brazil. The results showed close agreement with known geological structures of the basin. It also demonstrated the method's ability to map a sequence of alternating terraces and structural lows that could not be detected just by inspecting the gravity anomaly. To demostrate the method's flexibility in incorporating any a priori knowledge about the density contrast variation, it was applied to the Bouguer anomaly over the San Jacinto Graben, California. Two different exponential laws for the decrease of density contrast with depth were used, leading to estimated maximum depths between 2.2 and 2.4 km.},

  abstract = {A rearrangement of the formula used for the rapid calculation of the gravitational anomaly caused by a two-dimensional uneven layer of material (Parker, 1972) leads to an iterative procedure for calculating the shape of the perturbing body given the anomaly. The method readily handles large numbers of model points, and it is found empirically that convergence of the iteration can be assured by application of a low-pass filter. The nonuniqueness of the inversion can be characterized by two free parameters: the assumed density contrast between the two media, and the level at which the inverted topography is calculated. Additional geophysical knowledge is required to reduce this ambiguity. The inversion of a gravity profile perpendicular to a continental margin to find the location of the Moho is offered as a practical example of this method.},

The subsurface model consists of a 3D, equally spaced array of dipoles. The inversion incorporates a model norm that enforces sparseness and depth weighting of the solution.

The degree of improvement in model resolution for the sparse case is quantified using the resolution matrix.},

  abstract = {An extensive compilation of crustal thicknesses is used to develop crustal models in continental South America. We consider point crustal thicknesses from seismic refraction experiments, receiver function analyses, and surface-wave dispersion. Estimates of crustal thickness derived from gravity anomalies were only included along the continental shelf and in some areas of the Andes to fill large gaps in seismic coverage. Two crustal models were developed: A) by simple interpolation of the point estimates, and B) our preferred model, based on the same point estimates, interpolated with surface-wave tomography. Despite gaps in continental coverage, both models reveal interesting crustal thickness variations. In the Andean range, the crust reaches 75 km in Southern Peru and the Bolivian Altiplano, while crustal thicknesses seem to be close to the global continental average ({\textasciitilde} 40 km) in Ecuador and southern Colombia (despite high elevations), and along the southern Andes of Chile{\textendash}Argentina (elevation lower than 2000 m). In the stable continental platform the average thickness is 38 \ensuremath{\pm} 5 km (1-st. deviation) and no systematic differences are observed among Archean{\textendash}Paleoproterozoic cratons, NeoProterozoic fold belts, and low-altitude intracratonic sedimentary basins. An exception is the Borborema Province (NE Brazil) with crust {\textasciitilde} 30{\textendash}35 km thick. Narrow belts surrounding the cratons are suggested in central Brazil, parallel to the eastern and southern border of the Amazon craton, and possibly along the TransBrasiliano Lineament continuing into the Chaco basin, where crust thinner than 35 km is observed. In the sub-Andean region, between the mid-plate cratons and the Andean cordillera, the crust tends to be thinner ({\textasciitilde} 35 km) than the average crust in the stable platform, a feature possibly inherited from the old pre-Cambrian history of the continent. We expect that these crustal models will be useful for studies of isostasy, dynamic topography, and crustal evolution of the continent.},

Applying the receiver function technique to determine the crustal structure, there is evidence for an increase of the Moho depth from about 38 km below the Amazon Basin to approximately 48 km north of the basin. In addition, we analyzed the polarization of SKS-waves to determine anisotropy. The observed splitting parameters in a majority of the data set can be accounted for by a layer of axial symmetric anisotropy with the fast direction oriented roughly N110E. This direction cannot be associated with the present-day plate motion of the South American plate. However, the anisotropy may be related to a lithospheric fabric that was generated during the early tectonic history of the Amazonian Craton.},

A new closed-form formula for the curvature correction is derived for which the calculated values differ from those published by Swick by more than 0.5 mGal for high elevations. These corrections reduce those of an infinite slab (Bullard A) to that of a spherical cap having a surface radius of 166.7 km. The spherical cap produces a lesser effect than the infinite slab because of the {\textquotedblleft}truncation{\textquotedblright} of that part of the slab above the earth and extending to infinity, but it produces a greater effect than the slab because of subslab earth resulting from curvature. The physical significance of the correction lies in the combination of these two differences, which are each a function of elevation. The Bullard B surface radius (166.7 km: outer radius of the Hayford-Bowie system) is reaffirmed by the exact formula to be appropriate for exploration surveys. Three series approximations are presented and compared, but the exact Bullard B formula is very efficient and easy to program for routine data processing.},

The main purpose of this paper is to advocate the use of this graph in the numerical treatment of discrete ill-posed problems. The graph is characterized quantitatively, and several important relations between regularized solutions and the graph are derived.

The traditional approach to tackling this bias problem is cross-validation. The bootstrap is another way to bring down the high variability of cross-validation. But a direct comparison of the two estimators, cross-validation and bootstrap, is not fair because the latter estimator requires much heavier computation. We performed an empirical study to compare the~.632+~bootstrap estimator with the repeated 10-fold cross-validation and the repeated one-third holdout estimator. All the estimators were set to require about the same amount of computation. In the simulation study, the repeated 10-fold cross-validation estimator was found to have better performance than the~.632+~bootstrap estimator when the classifier is highly adaptive to the training sample. We have also found that the~.632+~bootstrap estimator suffers from a bias problem for large samples as well as for small samples.},

  doi = {10.1190/1.1444941},
  abstract = {To produce a unique and stable solution in potential-field interpretation, an inversion method must introduce particular constraints. These constraints will inevitably restrict the type of geological setting where the method may be applied. We present a nonmathematical overview of most stabilizing constraints used in inversion methods. Our purpose is to demonstrate that the inversion results are valuable only if the mathematical stabilizing constraints are translated from the geological setting. We identify five basic types of constraints: (1) lower and upper bounds of parameter estimates; (2) proximity of a parameter estimate to a specified value; (3) proximity between pairs of parameter estimates; (4) concentration of the anomalous source about a geometrical element such as an axis; and (5) source compactness. In practice, if used in isolation, constraints (1), (2), (4), and (5) will not produce geologically meaningful results, regardless of the geological setting of the interpretation area. Constraint (3) may produce geologically meaningful results if the anomalous source has a spatially smooth attribute such as the physical property. We illustrate that constraints 1{\textendash}4, if used in isolation, cannot delineate the geometry of a simulated sill intruded into a sedimentary basin. The basic constraints may (and should) be combined in inversion to produce geologically meaningful results. We present two examples of effective constraint combination: (1) proximity to a specific value and mass concentration about an axis (used to delineate the thickness variation of a sill intruded in a sedimentary basin) and (2) inequality, proximity of a parameter estimate to a specified value, and proximity between pairs of parameter estimates (used to map a discontinuous basement relief). Usually, the stabilizing constraints are too restrictive to hold at all points of a given geological environment. In this case, we use different constraints in different sub-areas. Each constraint is based on its compatibility with the actual geology of the subarea.},

The transform of the source geometry for any irregularly-shaped body can be accurately determined by representing the body as closely as possible by a number of prismatic bodies. The Green's function is not dependent upon the source geometry. So the analytical expression for its transform remains the same for all causative bodies. It is, therefore, not difficult to obtain the spectrum of an anomaly by multiplying the transform of the source geometry by that of the Green's function. Then the inverse of this spectrum, which yields the anomaly in the space domain, is calculated by using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Many examples show the reliability and accuracy of the method for calculating potential field anomalies.},

The criteria, which are established components of linear inverse theory, are applied to the linearized inverse problem at each iteration in a typical iterative, linearized solution to the non-linear problem. The particular inverse problem considered here is the simultaneous inversion of electromagnetic loop{\textendash}loop data for 1-D models of both electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility. The performance of each criteria is illustrated with inversions of a variety of synthetic and field data sets. In the great majority of examples tested, both criteria successfully determined suitable values of the regularization parameter, and hence credible models of the subsurface.},

  abstract = {We present a new three-dimensional SV-wave velocity model for the upper mantle beneath South America and the surrounding oceans, built from the waveform inversion of 5850 Rayleigh wave seismograms. The dense path coverage and the use of higher modes to supplement the fundamental mode of surface waves allow us to constrain seismic heterogeneities with horizontal wavelengths of a few hundred kilometres in the uppermost 400 km of the mantle.

The large scale features of our tomographic model confirm previous results from global and regional tomographic studies (e.g. the depth extent of the high velocity cratonic roots down to about 200{\textendash}250 km).

Several new features are highlighted in our model. Down to 100 km depth, the high velocity lid beneath the Amazonian craton is separated in two parts associated with the Guyana and Guapore shields, suggesting that the rifting episode responsible for the formation of the Amazon basin has involved a significant part of the lithosphere. Along the Andean subduction belt, the structure of the high velocity anomaly associated with the sudbduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate reflects the along-strike variation in dip of the subducting plate. Slow velocities are observed down to about 100 km and 150 km at the intersection of the Carnegie and Chile ridges with the continent and are likely to represent the thermal anomalies associated with the subducted ridges. These lowered velocities might correspond to zones of weakness in the subducted plate and may have led to the formation of {\textquotedblleft}slab windows{\textquotedblright} developed through unzipping of the subducted ridges; these windows might accommodate a transfer of asthenospheric mantle from the Pacific to the Atlantic ocean. From 150 to 250 km depth, the subducting Nazca plate is associated with high seismic velocities between 5{\textdegree}S and 37{\textdegree}S. We find high seismic velocities beneath the Paran{\'a} basin down to about 200 km depth, underlain by a low velocity anomaly in the depth range 200{\textendash}400 km located beneath the Ponta Grossa arc at the southern tip of the basin. This high velocity anomaly is located southward of a narrow S-wave low velocity structure observed between 200 and 500{\textendash}600 km depth in body wave studies, but irresolvable with our long period datasets. Both anomalies point to a model in which several, possibly diachronous, plumes have risen to the surface to generate the Paran{\'a} large igneous province (LIP).},

These maps include new data, helping to constrain crustal thickness, whole-crustal average P-wave and S-wave velocity, and the seismic velocity of the uppermost mantle (Pn and Sn). We find that: (1) The weighted average thickness of the crust under South America is 38.17 km (standard deviation, s.d.~\ensuremath{\pm}8.7 km), which is \ensuremath{\sim}1 km thinner than the global average of 39.2 km (s.d. \ensuremath{\pm}8.5 km) for continental crust. (2) Histograms of whole-crustal P-wave velocities for the South American crust are bi-modal, with the lower peak occurring for crust that appears to be missing a high-velocity (6.9{\textendash}7.3 km/s) lower crustal layer. (3) The average P-wave velocity of the crystalline crust (Pcc) is 6.47 km/s (s.d. \ensuremath{\pm}0.25 km/s). This is essentially identical to the global average of 6.45 km/s. (4) The average Pn velocity beneath South America is 8.00 km/s (s.d. \ensuremath{\pm}0.23 km/s), slightly lower than the global average of 8.07 km/s. (5) A region across northern Chile and northeast Argentina has anomalously low P- and S-wave velocities in the crust. Geographically, this corresponds to the shallowly-subducted portion of the Nazca plate (the Pampean flat slab first described by Isacks et~al., 1968), which is also a region of crustal extension. (6) The thick crust of the Brazilian craton appears to extend into Venezuela and Colombia. (7) The crust in the Amazon basin and along the western edge of the Brazilian craton may be thinned by extension. (8) The average crustal P-wave velocity under the eastern Pacific seafloor is higher than under the western Atlantic seafloor, most likely due to the thicker sediment layer on the older Atlantic seafloor.},

  abstract = {Comparative analysis of coseismic and postseismic variations of the Earth's gravity field is carried for the regions of three giant earthquakes (Andaman-Sumatra, December 26, 2004, magnitude M w = 9.1; Maule-Chile, February 27, 2010, M w = 8.8, and Tohoku-Oki, March 11, 2011, M w = 9.0) with the use of GRACE satellite data. Within the resolution of GRACE models, the coseismic changes of gravity caused by these seismic events manifest themselves by large negative anomalies located in the rear of the subduction zone. The real data are compared with the synthetic anomalies calculated from the rupture surface models based on different kinds of ground measurements. It is shown that the difference between the gravity anomalies corresponding to different rupture surface models exceeds the uncertainties of the GRACE data. There-fore, the coseismic gravity anomalies are at least suitable for rejecting part of the models that are equivalent in the ground data. Within the first few months after the Andaman-Sumatra earthquake, a positive gravity anomaly started to grow above the deep trench. This anomaly rapidly captured the area of the back-arc basin and largely compensated the negative coseismic anomaly. The processes of viscoelastic stress relaxation do not fully allow for these rapid changes of gravity. According to the calculations, even with a sufficiently low viscosity of the upper mantle, relaxation only covers about a half of the observed change of the field. In order to explain the remaining temporal variations, we suggested the process of downdip propagation of the coseismic rupture surface. The feasibility of such a process was supported by numerical simulations. The sum of the gravity anomalies caused by this process and the anomaly generated by the processes of viscoelastic relaxation accounts well for the observed changes of the gravity field in the region of the earthquake. The similar postseismic changes of gravity were also detected for the region of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Just as in the case discussed above, this earthquake was also followed by a rapid growth of a positive postseismic anomaly, which partially counterbalanced the negative coseismic anomaly. The time variations of the gravity field in the region of the Maule-Chile earthquake differ from the pattern of changes observed in the island arcs described above. The postseismic gravity variations are in this case concentrated in a narrower band above the deep trench and shelf, and they do not spread over the continental territory, where the negative coseismic anomaly is located. These discrepancies reflect the difference in the geodynamical settings of the studied earthquakes.},

  abstract = {With the recently available high resolution gravity data from the GOCE satellite a whole range of crustal thickness models have been derived. The added value of GOCE is that it provides data globally, including regions that are poorly covered by seismological studies, like large parts of Africa and South America. Potentially these models can provide new insight in crustal structure for these data poor regions. We compare different models of crustal thickness for South America and Africa and attempt to assess the quality of different modelling techniques and the impact of different data sources. We introduce one new global crustal thickness model based on gravity data, DMM-1, and use seven additional, recently published, continental or global crustal thickness models based on gravity or seismological data. All models use different modelling techniques, and either gravity (four models) or seismological data (four models). We will show that significant differences exist between the models but that these cannot be directly related to the used data. Choices made in the selection and parametrization of the various modelling techniques have more impact than using different data sources including data sources of supposed higher quality. The significant differences, up to 28 km, between models can have a major influence on geodynamical analysis for the two continents. We propose that future work should focus on developing a standard for modelling in data sparse environments, and expanding seismological efforts in those regions that are most different between the shown models to verify the actual crustal thickness. Furthermore, the contribution and inclusion of (satellite) gravity data in crustal thickness models should be further explored.},

A high-cut filter in the frequency domain has been incorporated to enhance the convergence in the iterative process.

Using a filter for downward continuing the Bouguer anomaly, we have computed a variety of crustal thickness maps for the Moon, assuming both a homogeneous as well as a dual-layered crust. The crustal thickness maps for the homogeneous model give plausible results, but this model is not consistent with the seismic data, petrologic evidence, and geoid to topography ratios, all of which suggest some form of crustal stratification. Several dual-layered models were investigated, and it was found that only models with both upper and lower crustal thickness variations could satisfy the gravity and topography data. These models predict that the entire upper crust has been excavated beneath the major nearside multiring basins. Additionally, significant amounts of lower crustal material was excavated from these basins, especially beneath Crisium. This model also predicts that mantle material should not have been excavated during the South-Pole Aitken basin forming event, and that lower crustal material should be exposed at the surface in this basin.},

Initially, we obtain a linear approximation stabilized by the total variation functional that correctly maps the horizontal positions of the existing high-angle faults but produced poor estimates of the basin depths. Subsequent iterations update the depth estimates toward the correct values, at the same time preserving the correct fault horizontal positions. Additionally, we stabilize each solution correction by the smoothness constraint without inverting any matrix. The method was substantially more efficient than the nonlinear method, which solves a system of linear equations by the conjugate gradient method at each iteration. For 3000 parameters, it is almost four times faster than the conjugate gradient, and this ratio increased with the number of parameters.},

  abstract = {We have developed a fast total-field anomaly inversion to estimate the magnetization direction of multiple sources with approximately spherical shapes and known centres. Our method is an overdetermined inverse problem that can be applied to interpret multiple sources with different but homogeneous magnetization directions. It requires neither the prior computation of any transformation-like reduction to the pole nor the use of regularly spaced data on a horizontal grid. The method contains flexibility to be implemented as a linear or non-linear inverse problem, which results, respectively, in a least-squares or robust estimate of the components of the magnetization vector of the sources. Applications to synthetic data show the robustness of our method against interfering anomalies and errors in the location of the sources' centre. Besides, we show the feasibility of applying the upward continuation to interpret non-spherical sources. Applications to field data over the Goi{\'a}s alkaline province (GAP), Brazil, show the good performance of our method in estimating geologically meaningful magnetization directions. The results obtained for a region of the GAP, near to the alkaline complex of Diorama, suggest the presence of non-outcropping sources marked by strong remanent magnetization with inclination and declination close to -70.35 and -19.81{\textdegree}, respectively. This estimated magnetization direction leads to predominantly positive reduced-to-the-pole anomalies, even for other region of the GAP, in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goi{\'a}s. These results show that the non-outcropping sources near to the alkaline complex of Diorama have almost the same magnetization direction of those ones in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goi{\'a}s, strongly suggesting that these sources have been emplaced in the crust within almost the same geological time interval.},

  abstract = {We present a method to estimate the basement relief as well as the density contrast at the surface and the hyperbolic decaying factor of the density contrast with depth, assuming that the gravity anomaly and the depth to the basement at a few points are known. In both cases, the interpretation model is a set of vertical rectangular 2D prisms whose thicknesses are parameters to be estimated and that represent the depth to the interface separating sediments and basement. The solutions to both problems are stable because of the incorporation of additional prior information about the smoothness of the estimated relief and the depth to the basement at a few locations, presumably provided by boreholes. The method was tested with synthetic gravity anomalies produced by simulated sedimentary basins with smooth relief, providing not only well-resolved estimated relief, but also good estimates for the density contrasts at the surface and for the decaying factors of the density contrast with depth. The method was applied to the Bouguer anomaly from Rec{\^o}ncavo Basin, estimating the surface density contrast and the decaying factor of the density contrast with depth as  -0.30g/cm3\ensuremath{<}math overflow="scroll" display="inline"\ensuremath{>} \ensuremath{<}mrow\ensuremath{><}mo\ensuremath{>}-\ensuremath{<}/mo\ensuremath{><}mn\ensuremath{>}0.30\ensuremath{<}/mn\ensuremath{>} \ensuremath{<}mspace width="0.3em"\ensuremath{><}/mspace\ensuremath{><}mi mathvariant="normal"\ensuremath{>}g\ensuremath{<}/mi\ensuremath{><}mo\ensuremath{>}∕\ensuremath{<}/mo\ensuremath{>} \ensuremath{<}msup\ensuremath{><}mi\ensuremath{>}cm\ensuremath{<}/mi\ensuremath{><}mn\ensuremath{>}3\ensuremath{<}/mn\ensuremath{><}/msup\ensuremath{>} \ensuremath{<}/mrow\ensuremath{>} \ensuremath{<}/math\ensuremath{>}  and  30km\ensuremath{<}math overflow="scroll" display="inline"\ensuremath{>} \ensuremath{<}mrow\ensuremath{><}mn\ensuremath{>}30\ensuremath{<}/mn\ensuremath{>} \ensuremath{<}mspace width="0.3em"\ensuremath{><}/mspace\ensuremath{><}mi\ensuremath{>}km\ensuremath{<}/mi\ensuremath{><}/mrow\ensuremath{>} \ensuremath{<}/math\ensuremath{>} , respectively.},

  abstract = {The GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) mission, launched on March 2009, included a new type of satellite instrument, an on-board three-axis gradiometer able to measure the Earth's gravity gradients at the satellite height (255 km). The potential of this new type of measurement and its derived products (i.e., global gravity field models), together with other land-based geophysical observables (Bouguer and geoid anomalies), to image sub-lithospheric thermal and compositional anomalies is evaluated in this study. We focus on the Atlantic-Mediterranean Transition Region (AMTR), the diffuse, transpressive contact between the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. The present-day lithospheric structure in the area is characterized by a wide band of active deformation, large lateral variations in the lithosphere and the presence of a positive seismic-velocity anomaly in the uppermost mantle beneath the Betics and the westernmost Alboran Basin-Gibraltar Arc. Here, the perturbing effects of deep, sub-lithospheric density anomalies in GOCE gravity gradients and other land-based geophysical data are assessed, and its impact in lithospheric-scale geophysical-petrological modeling within a thermodynamically consistent framework analyzed. Some of the gravity gradients computed at the satellite altitude are rather sensitive to the presence of even a relatively small sub-lithospheric cold slab, like the one observed in the AMTR, showing the potential of the new GOCE data to map upper mantle anomalies. Lithospheric models ignoring the AMTR sub-lithospheric heterogeneities could be significantly biased. In particular, extreme changes of 4{\textendash}6 km and 60{\textendash}70 km in the crustal and lithospheric thickness, respectively, are required to include sub-lithospheric mantle contributions to land-based and satellite gravity data.},

The prisms' thicknesses represent the depths to the basement and are the parameters to be estimated from the gravity data. To estimate the parameters defining the parabolic decay of the density contrast with depth and to produce stable depth-to-basement estimates, we imposed smoothness on the basement depths and proximity between estimated and known depths at boreholes. We applied our method to synthetic data from a simulated complex 3D basement relief with two sedimentary sections having distinct parabolic laws describing the density-contrast variation with depth. The results provide good estimates of the true parameters of the parabolic law of density-contrast decay with depth and of the basement relief. Inverting the gravity data from the onshore and part of the shallow offshore Almada Basin on Brazil's northeastern coast shows good correlation with known structural features.},

The sedimentary pack is approximated by a grid of 3D or 2D vertical prisms juxtaposed in the horizontal directions of a right-handed coordinate system. The prisms' thicknesses represent the depths to the basement and are the parameters to be estimated from the gravity data. To obtain depth-to-basement estimates, we introduce the total variation (TV) regularization as a stabilizing function. This approach lets us estimate a nonsmooth basement relief because it does not penalize sharp features of the solution. We have deduced a compact matrix form of the gradient vector and the Hessian matrix of the approximation to the TV function that allows a regularized Gauss-Newton minimization approach. Because the Hessian matrix of the approximation to the TV function is ill conditioned, we have modified this Hessian matrix to improve its condition and to accelerate the convergence of the Gauss-Newton algorithm. Tests conducted with synthetic data show that the inversion method can delineate discontinuous basements presenting large slips or sequences of small-slip step faults. Tests on field data from the Almada Basin, Brazil, and from the San Jacinto Graben, California, U.S.A., confirm the potential of the method in detecting and locating in-depth normal faults in the basement relief of a sedimentary basin.},

  abstract = {We present a crustal thickness map of Brazil and adjacent areas based on a compilation of data published in the literature as well as new measurements. We used crustal thicknesses mainly derived from seismic datasets such as deep seismic refraction experiments, receiver function analyses, and surface-wave dispersion velocities. Crustal thicknesses derived from modelling gravity anomalies commonly depend on assumptions, such as constant density contrast across the Moho interface, which are not always easily verifiable and were considered only along the continental shelf to fill large gaps in the seismic data. Our compilation shows that the crust in the stable continental area onshore has an average thickness of 39~\ensuremath{\pm}~5~km (1-\ensuremath{\sigma} deviation) and that no clear difference can be observed between low altitude, intracratonic sedimentary basins, NeoProterozoic foldbelts (except for the Borborema Province), and cratonic areas. The thinnest crust is found in the Borborema Province of NE Brazil (30{\textendash}35~km) and along a narrow belt within Tocantins Province (\ensuremath{\sim}35~km), roughly parallel to the Eastern border of the Amazon craton, while the thickest crust is found in the Amazon and S{\~a}o Francisco cratons (41~\ensuremath{\pm}~4~km), and the Paran{\'a} Basin (42~\ensuremath{\pm}~4~km). Both the Ponta Grossa and the Rio Grande Arches are areas of thinned crust, and the western border of the Brazilian platform, near the sub-Andean region, seems to be characterized by a crustal thickness of less than 40~km. Although sparse in data coverage, we expect the resulting crustal thickness map to be useful for future studies of isostasy, dynamic topography, and crustal evolution of the country.},

  abstract = {The gravity anomaly field over the whole Earth obtained by the GOCE satellite is a revolutionary tool to reveal geologic information on a continental scale for the large areas where conventional gravity measurements have yet to be made. It is, however, necessary to isolate the near-surface geologic signal from the contributions of thickness variations in the crust and lithosphere and the isostatic compensation of surface relief. Here Africa is studied with particular emphasis on selected geological features which are expected to appear as density inhomogeneities. These include cratons and fold belts in the Precambrian basement, the overlying sedimentary basins and magmatism, as well as the continental margins. Regression analysis between gravity and topography shows coefficients that are consistently positive for the free air gravity anomaly and negative for the Bouguer gravity anomaly. The error and scatter on the regression are smallest in oceanic areas, where it is a possible tool for identifying changes in crustal type. The regression analysis allows the large gradient in the Bouguer anomaly signal across continental margins to be removed. After subtracting the predicted effect of known topography from the original Bouguer anomaly field, the residual field shows a continent-wide pattern of anomalies that could be attributed to regional geological structures. A few of these are highlighted, such as those representing Karoo magmatism, the Kibalian foldbelt, the Zimbabwe Craton, the Cameroon and Tibesti volcanic deposits, the Benue Trough and the Luangwa Rift. A reconstruction of the pre-break up position of Africa and South America (the plates forming West Gondwana) is made for the residual GOCE gravity field. The reconstruction allows the positive and negative anomalies to be compared across the continental fragments, and so helps identify common geologic units that extend across both the now-separate continents.},

  abstract = {Geophysics uses gravity to learn about the density variations of the Earth's interior, whereas classical geodesy uses gravity to define the geoid. This difference in purpose has led to some confusion among geophysicists, and this tutorial attempts to clarify two points of the confusion. First, it is well known now that gravity anomalies after the {\textquotedblleft}free-air{\textquotedblright} correction are still located at their original positions. However, the {\textquotedblleft}free-air{\textquotedblright} reduction was thought historically to relocate gravity from its observation position to the geoid (mean sea level). Such an understanding is a geodetic fiction, invalid and unacceptable in geophysics. Second, in gravity corrections and gravity anomalies, the elevation has been used routinely. The main reason is that, before the emergence and widespread use of the Global Positioning System (GPS), height above the geoid was the only height measurement we could make accurately (i.e., by leveling). The GPS delivers a measurement of height above the ellipsoid. In principle, in the geophysical use of gravity, the ellipsoid height rather than the elevation should be used throughout because a combination of the latitude correction estimated by the International Gravity Formula and the height correction is designed to remove the gravity effects due to an ellipsoid of revolution. In practice, for minerals and petroleum exploration, use of the elevation rather than the ellipsoid height hardly introduces significant errors across the region of investigation because the geoid is very smooth. Furthermore, the gravity effects due to an ellipsoid actually can be calculated by a closed-form expression. However, its approximation, by the International Gravity Formula and the height correction including the second-order terms, is typically accurate enough worldwide.},

Also, we extended Bott's method to (1)~be applicable to sedimentary basins with density contrast between the sediments and the basement decreasing with depth according to different laws, (2)~optimize the modulus of the parameter correction vector, (3)~stabilize the solution by imposing that it be smooth, and (4)~quit the iteration according to an objective and effective criterion. To keep up the efficiency of Bott's method, stable solutions were obtained by applying a moving average to the usually unstable solution obtained at the last iteration. Solutions as efficacious as those obtained by the usual nonlinear method were produced by the present extension at a much smaller computation time. Nonlinear methods, with different implementations for solving a linear system of equations, required between one and two orders of magnitude more time to produce similar solutions using between 2000 and 3000 parameters and observations, for example.},

However, the estimated ice loss rate from glaciers in northwest Greenland has increased from 30.9 \ensuremath{\pm} 8 Gt/yr over the first few years (2002{\textendash}2005) to 128.2 \ensuremath{\pm} 33 Gt/yr for the more recent period (2007{\textendash}2009), while the loss rate in southeast Greenland for the more recent period has become almost negligible, down from 109 \ensuremath{\pm} 28 Gt/yr of just a few years ago. The rapid change in the nature of the regional ice mass in southeast and northwest Greenland, in the course of only several years, further reinforces the idea that the Greenland ice sheet mass balance is very vulnerable to regional climate conditions. The dramatic slow down of ice loss in southeast Greenland observed by GRACE provides an independent verification of similar reports from other remote sensing data. The observed significant interannual variability of Greenland ice mass change suggests that it is very challenging to quantify Greenland's long-term ice mass change rates, and some observed apparent accelerations might simply be a reflection of the interannual variability.},

  abstract = {We propose a new estimate of the mass balance of the West/East Antarctica and Greenland ice sheets from GRACE for the recent period (July 2002{\textendash}March 2005) and compute the corresponding contribution to the global mean sea level. We use new GRACE geoid solutions provided by the Groupe de Recherche en G{\'e}od{\'e}sie Spatiale (GRGS/CNES), at the resolution of \ensuremath{\sim} 400 km and sampled at 10-day interval. In the three regions, significant interannual variations are observed, which we approximate as linear trends over the short time span of analysis. Over Greenland, an apparent total volume loss of 119 +/- 10 cu km/yr water is observed. For the Antarctica ice sheet, a bimodal behaviour is apparent, with volume loss amounting to 88 +/- 10 cu km/yr water in the West, and increase in the East amounting to 72 +/- 20 cu km/yr water. These GRACE results are affected by land hydrology contamination and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) of the solid Earth since last deglaciation. We correct for both land hydrology contamination (using a global hydrological model) and GIA using the ICE-4G model for Greenland and the IJ05 model for Antarctica. Corrected for both land hydrology contamination and GIA, GRACE volume rates are - 129 +/- 15 cu km/yr, - 107 +/- 23 cu km/yr and + 67 +/- 28 cu km/yr for Greenland, West Antarctica and East Antarctica respectively. In terms of sea level rise, the GRACE-based ice sheets contributions are + 0.36 +/- 0.04 mm/yr for Greenland, + 0.30 +/- 0.06 mm/yr for West Antarctica and - 0.19 +/- 0.07 for East Antarctica for the time interval of study. The total Antarctica contribution to sea level over this short time span is thus slightly positive (+ 0.11 +/- 0.09 mm/yr). The ice sheets together contribute to a sea level rise of 0.47 +/- 0.1 mm/yr. The results reported here are in qualitative agreement with recent estimates of the mass balance of the ice sheets based on GRACE and with those based upon other remote sensing observations. Due to the very short sampling time span for which the GRACE data are available, it is not yet possible to distinguish between interannual oscillations and long-term trend associated with climate change.},

This resolution makes GOCE gravity gradient data in particular useful for lithospheric scale modeling. However, the relation between coordinates in a model frame and at satellite altitude is not straightforward, and most geophysical modeling programs require a planar approximation, which may not be appropriate for satellite data. We derive the exact relation between the model reference frame, in which gradients from lithospheric modeling are given, and the local north-oriented frame in which GOCE gradients at 255\hspace{0.167em}km altitude are given. We generated gradients from a GOCE gravity field model and assessed whether the orientation differences between local north-oriented frame and model reference frame are relevant. In addition, we assessed the same for airborne gradiometry at an altitude of 5\hspace{0.167em}km because these data are complementary to GOCE. We find that if the regional area has a longitude extension of 5{\textdegree}, the errors stay below 10\%. For larger areas the standard deviation of the systematic errors may be 40\% of the signal standard deviation. Comparing topographic mass reduction in planar and spherical approximation, one sees significant long wavelength differences in terms of gravity gradients or gradient-tensor invariants. The maximum error is up to 1 E at satellite altitude compared with maximum signal amplitude of 3 E. Planar approximation is therefore not accurate enough for topographic mass reduction of GOCE gravity gradients.},

  abstract = {The Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) is the European Space Agency's (ESA) satellite gravity mission to determine the Earth's mean gravity field. GOCE delivers gravity gradients, a new type of satellite data. We study how these data can improve modeling of the Earth's lithosphere. We discuss the use of the original GOCE gravity gradients versus the use of gravity gradients in grids at satellite altitude or close the Earth's surface and conclude that grids are easier to handle than the original data because one does not have to deal with very different error characteristics of the different gradients, given in a rotating frame at varying heights. The downward continuation to the surface enhances signal and better reflects the near-surface geology. But this does not outweigh the amplification of noise and omission errors, which is why we recommend using the field at mean satellite altitude for lithospheric modeling. The North-East Atlantic region is ideal to analyze the additional value of GOCE gravity gradients because it is a well-studied region in terms of regional geophysics. We calculated the gradient sensitivity for crustal depth slices using a 3D lithospheric model. This reveals that especially interfaces with large density contrasts have a distinct signal in the gravity gradients, but that they are quite insensitive to intra-crustal density sources, which can have quite a large effect on surface gravity data. We also show that the satellite gradients have a depth sensitivity well suited to study the upper mantle density structure, making them complementary to gravity and seismic tomography. In the underexplored Rub'al-Khali area the GOCE vertical gradient was used to invert for crustal thickness. The updated Moho model gives a good fit to four of the six gradients and independent depths from seismic stations. The Moho model was used to update the heat flow model and source rock maturity maps, which are generally consistent with known source rock maturity trends in the surrounding regions. GOCE gradients are therefore useful to map crustal thickness and deep regional structures for frontier areas. In combination with other data, heat flow can be modeled which is essential for basin maturity evaluation.},

However, the smeared-out models resulting from L2-norm inversions are not always consistent with the real or expected geological structures, especially in regions where distinct interfaces between different rock units exist. To obtain sharp boundaries and blocky features, non-L2 inversions have been used successfully in geophysical imaging problems. In reality, however, both smooth and blocky features can be present in the subsurface physical properties or interfaces to be recovered. To deal with this situation, we develop a new method for adaptively recovering both smooth and blocky features in the constructed model from geophysical inversions. This method first detects different regions of the smoothness or blockiness in a model based on a sequence of inversions and then adaptively applies appropriate Lp model norm with different p values at different locations to complete the final inversion. We present two synthetic examples from basement inversion using gravity data and crosswell seismic traveltime tomography before demonstrating our method on a field data example at the U.S. Geological Survey Fractured Rock Research Site in central New Hampshire.},

  abstract = {The calculation of topographic (and iso- static) reductions is one of the most time-consuming operations in gravity field modelling. For this calculation, the topographic surface of the Earth is often divided with respect to geographical or map-grid lines, and the topographic heights are averaged over the respective grid elements. The bodies bounded by surfaces of constant (ellipsoidal) heights and geographical grid lines are denoted as tesseroids. Usually these ellipsoidal (or spherical) tesseroids are replaced by {\textquotedblleft}equivalent{\textquotedblright} vertical rectangular prisms of the same mass. This approximation is motivated by the fact that the volume integrals for the calculation of the potential and its derivatives can be exactly solved for rectangular prisms, but not for the tesseroids. In this paper, an approximate solution of the spherical tesseroid integrals is provided based on series expansions including third-order terms. By choosing the geometrical centre of the tesseroid as the Taylor expansion point, the number of non-vanishing series terms can be greatly reduced. The zero-order term is equivalent to the point-mass formula. Test computations show the high numerical efficiency of the tesseroid method versus the prism approach, both regarding computation time and accuracy. Since the approximation errors due to the truncation of the Taylor series decrease very quickly with increasing distance of the tesseroid from the computation point, only the elements in the direct vicinity of the computation point have to be separately evaluated, e.g. by the prism formulas. The results are also compared with the point-mass formula. Further potential refinements of the tesseroid approach, such as considering ellipsoidal tesseroids, are indicated.},

  abstract = {The Quadril{\'a}tero Ferr{\'\i}fero in southeastern Brazil hosts one of the largest concentrations of lateritic iron ore deposits in the world. Our study area is over the southern flank of the Gandarela syncline which is one of the regional synclines of the Quadril{\'a}tero Ferr{\'\i}fero. The Gandarela syncline is considered the Brazilian megastructure with the highest perspectives for iron ore exploration. Most of the iron-ore deposits from the Quadril{\'a}tero Ferr{\'\i}fero are non-outcropping bodies hosted in the oxidized, metamorphosed and heterogeneously deformed banded iron formations. Therefore, the assessment of the 3D geometry of the iron-ore body is of the utmost importance for estimating reserves and production development planning. We carried out a quantitative interpretation of the iron-ore deposit of the southern flank of the Gandarela syncline using a 3D inversion of airborne gravity-gradient data to estimate the shape of the iron-ore mineralization. The retrieved body is characterized by a high-density zone associated with the northeast-elongated iron formation. The thickness and the width of the retrieved iron-ore body vary along its strike increasing southwestward. The presence of a large volume of iron ore in the southwest portion of the study area may be due to the hinge zone of the Gandarela syncline, which is the zone of maximum compression. Our estimated iron-ore mass reveals variable dip directions. In the southernmost, central and northernmost portions of the study area, the estimated iron body dips, respectively, inwards, vertically and outwards with respect to the syncline axis. Previous geological mapping indicated continuous mineralization. However, our result suggests a quasi-continuous iron-ore body. In the central part of the study area, the estimated iron-ore body is segmented into two parts. This breakup may be related to the northwest-trending faults, which are perpendicular to the northeast-trending axis of the Gandarela syncline. Our estimated iron-ore mass agrees reasonably well with the information provided from the lithologic logging data of drill holes. In this geophysical study, the estimated iron-ore reserves are approximately 3 billion tons.},

  abstract = {Various tasks in geodesy, geophysics, and related geosciences require precise information on the impact of mass distributions on gravity field-related quantities, such as the gravitational potential and its partial derivatives. Using forward modeling based on Newton's integral, mass distributions are generally decomposed into regular elementary bodies. In classical approaches, prisms or point mass approximations are mostly utilized. Considering the effect of the sphericity of the Earth, alternative mass modeling methods based on tesseroid bodies (spherical prisms) should be taken into account, particularly in regional and global applications. Expressions for the gravitational field of a point mass are relatively simple when formulated in Cartesian coordinates. In the case of integrating over a tesseroid volume bounded by geocentric spherical coordinates, it will be shown that it is also beneficial to represent the integral kernel in terms of Cartesian coordinates. This considerably simplifies the determination of the tesseroid's potential derivatives in comparison with previously published methodologies that make use of integral kernels expressed in spherical coordinates. Based on this idea, optimized formulas for the gravitational potential of a homogeneous tesseroid and its derivatives up to second-order are elaborated in this paper. These new formulas do not suffer from the polar singularity of the spherical coordinate system and can, therefore, be evaluated for any position on the globe. Since integrals over tesseroid volumes cannot be solved analytically, the numerical evaluation is achieved by means of expanding the integral kernel in a Taylor series with fourth-order error in the spatial coordinates of the integration point. As the structure of the Cartesian integral kernel is substantially simplified, Taylor coefficients can be represented in a compact and computationally attractive form. Thus, the use of the optimized tesseroid formulas particularly benefits from a significant decrease in computation time by about 45 \% compared to previously used algorithms. In order to show the computational efficiency and to validate the mathematical derivations, the new tesseroid formulas are applied to two realistic numerical experiments and are compared to previously published tesseroid methods and the conventional prism approach.},

  abstract = {The crustal structure of northern Africa is puzzling, large areas being of difficult access and concealed by the Sahara. The new global gravity models are of unprecedented precision and spatial resolution and offer a new possibility to reveal the structure of the lithosphere beneath the Sahara. The gravity gradients correlate better than gravity with geological features such as rifts, fold belts and magmatic deposits and intrusions. They are an ideal tool to follow geological units (e.g. basement units) below a stratigraphic layer of varying density (e.g. sediments). We focus on the Chad lineament, a 1300 km arcuate feature located between the west and central African rift system. The gravity fields show differences between the lineament and the west and central African rift system. Along the centre of the lineament high-density rocks must be present, which relate to either magmatic or metamorphic rocks. This is very different to the lineaments of the western and central-west African rift system which are filled with sediments. Considering present models of rifting and the absence of topography, the lineament cannot be coeval to the west and central African rift system and is most likely older. We suggest that the lineament is a structural element of the Saharan Metacraton.},
